# note-taker

Welcome to my Note Taker app!

This was a very difficult assignment and I learned a lot doing it.  
-Using Insomnia was crucial to what I was able to deploy - I had several disconnects in my pages due to how my folders were setup and using Insomnia helped me find some of those disconnects.

-I used Heroku to deploy the app and that was challenging since I didn't get to use it during the async class due to download issues.  I was able to successfully deploy to Heroku so that was kind of exciting.

You will find that running the app will return the landing page but clicking to Start goes to the Notes page - and isn't connecting to the css and js files correctly.  I haven't figured out the error there.  I think it has to do with the way my folders are setup.  

This app is very similar to the Zookeeper app we built in the async class so I credit much of the work to that app.
